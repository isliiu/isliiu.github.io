    <h1>about</h1>

    <p>
        during the summer of 2022 as i watched girls and women getting denied access to life-saving
        reproductive healthcare, i was determined to take action but i didn't know how i could from
        taipei. with two friends, i created clothes 4 roe, a series of secondhand clothes sales
        benefiting reproductive rights nonprofits in the united states. i am grounded by a desire to
        solve meaningful problems through community, whether it's bridging the gender gap in stem
        or mitigating the harms of artificial intelligence on marginalized communities. over the
        years, i have been lucky to learn from compassionate and talented people at kode with
        klossy, girl up, public citizen, global fund for women, the national science foundation, and
        more. as a creative technologist and activist, i hope to continue building, researching, and
        advocating for a better world.
